# YouTube View Count Prediction and Viewers Analsysis Model
This study focuses on the predictive analysis of YouTube view counts, 
employing the CatBoost algorithm to model and forecast viewership 
trends. Leveraging the YouTube API, data was collected from a specific 
channel, encompassing video metadata and comment sentiment 
analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of audience 
engagement dynamics. 
 
The CatBoost algorithm, known for its robustness in handling 
categorical variables and its ability to mitigate overfitting, was chosen 
for its suitability in predicting view counts amidst the complex 
landscape of YouTube content. Through feature engineering and model 
optimization, our analysis aimed to uncover the key factors influencing 
video popularity and viewership dynamics. 
 
Data collection was facilitated through the YouTube API, enabling the 
extraction of video metadata such as title, description, and tags, along 
with engagement metrics including likes, dislikes, and comments. 
Additionally, sentiment analysis was performed on the comment 
section to gauge audience sentiment and its impact on viewership. 
 
The results of our analysis highlight the significance of various factors 
such as video length, title sentiment, and viewer interaction in 
influencing view counts. Furthermore, the CatBoost model 
demonstrated strong predictive performance, accurately capturing the 
nuances of audience behavior and content preferences.
